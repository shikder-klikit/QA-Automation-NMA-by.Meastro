[Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) is built on learnings from its predecessors (Appium, Espresso, UIAutomator, XCTest, Selenium, Playwright) and allows you to easily define and test your Flows.
**[Installing Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro)**
Run the following command to install Maestro on macOS, Linux or Windows (WSL):

`curl -fsSL "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash`

If you're on macOS, you can use Homebrew instead of the install script above:


`brew tap mobile-dev-inc/tap`


`brew install maestro`

**Connecting to Your Device**

`maestro test`

will automatically detect and use any local emulator or USB-connected physical device.

Note: At the moment, Maestro does not support physical iOS devices
